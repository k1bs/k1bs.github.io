          <p>Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a full-stack web developer,
            lover of games and game design, caffeine addict, React ninja,
            and have been making glasses cool again since 1997.
            <br /><br />
            You should totally hire me.</p>

              <p>Test Your Might is my loving recreation of the Mortal Kombat
                minigame of the same name. The user (and his bitter enemy)
                attempt to shatter the boards in front of their avatars. As the
                board material changes, the difficulty increases!
                <br /><br />
                This project makes use of extensive DOM manipulation, primarily
                using jQuery. Future improvements include the user's ability to
                select a character and further refactoring.</p>
