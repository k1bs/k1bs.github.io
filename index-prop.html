          <p>Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a full-stack web developer,
            lover of games and game design, caffeine addict, React ninja,
            and have been making glasses cool again since 1997.
            <br /><br />
            You should totally hire me.</p>

              <p>chk(mark) is a simple note-taking web app that allows the user to
                write in Markdown, with the viewable note rendered in HTML.
                This full CRUD project makes use of a React/Redux front end, with a Rails
                API backend, and uses rexxars' excellent <a href="https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown" target="_blank">react-markdown</a> module.
                <br /><br />
                This project was one I undertook with the express purpose of
                teaching myself how to impiment and use Redux. Casting aside
                my usual React habits was difficult, but I now have a deep
                appreciation for how a library like Redux could simplify a
                larger project.</p>
                <p>Moving forward, I plan on further refactoring for edge
                cases around large images and complex tables.</p>

              <p>Lionbot is a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a> chat bot, allowing the user to automate
                certain commands in their Twitch chatroom. When a Twitch streamer
                becomes popular, they often find themselves answering the same
                viewer questions repeatedly. Lionbot helps with that.
                <br /><br />
                This project is a full CRUD JavaScript stack, using React for the
                front end. This was a group project, and really helped me
                learn good group git habits.
                <br /><br />
                For a demonstration, use the 'demo'/'demo' username/password
                combination. In addition, you can see it working in <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/k1bsTV">my Twitch chat</a>.</p>

              <p>Test Your Might is my loving recreation of the Mortal Kombat
                minigame of the same name. The user (and his bitter enemy)
                attempt to shatter the boards in front of their avatars. As the
                board material changes, the difficulty increases!
                <br /><br />
                This project makes use of extensive DOM manipulation, primarily
                using jQuery. Future improvements include the user's ability to
                select a character and further refactoring.</p>
